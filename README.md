# How AI-Powered Shopping Carts Are Revolutionizing The Consumer Shopping Experience
## Overview and Origin
<p>Maplebear Inc. doing business as Instacart is an American delivery company headquartered in San Fransico, CA.  The company name is derived from the word Maple which represents Canada and the word Bear which represents the logo on the California State flag.</p> 
<p>Instacart was founded in June 2012 by Apoorva Mehta.  Apoorva was born in 1986 in Jodhpur, India and moved to Hamilton, Ontario, Canada in 2000.  He graduated with a degree in electrical engineering from the University of Waterloo and founded Instacart at age.</p>
<p>Founder Apoorva Mehta got the inspiration for the company while living in Canada without a car, being low on groceries, and experiencing traveling by bus to the grocery store.  Apoorva initially secured 2.3 million in funding from Y Combinator in the summer of 2012 which enabled him to meet his two co-founders Max Mullen and Brandon Leonardo and in September of 2023, the company raised $600 million in its initial public offering. </p>

## Business Activities
<p>Instacart is well known for its grocery delivery and pickup services boosting more than 600,000+ shoppers as of December 2021 across the U.S. and Canada.   Less well-known is the fact that Instacart offers a suite of technology products to businesses through their Instacart Platform.  The Instacart Platform includes hardware and software offerings for businesses to power the store of the future, upgraded technology to power an organizations brand online experience, plug-and-play e-commerce capabilities to elevate your website, marketing solutions to help differentiate your business from your competitors, and AI smart cart technology called Caper Cart which is revolutionizing the point-of-sale consumer shopping experience.    “We made an early bet that smart carts would be the winning technology for transforming the in-store grocery experience because it’s a form factor people recognize and it doesn’t require retrofitting a whole store with large capex investments,” Instacart CEO Fidji Simo said in the company’s 2024 first-quarter shareholder letter. “Our Caper Carts do so much more than allow people to skip checkout.” “We’re transforming shopping from a chore to an adventure,” Instacart told Fortune.</p>

</ul>
</p>
<p>Amazon launched its first Amazon Go store in Seatle, WA in January of 2018.  The Amazon-owned convenience stores allowed customers to walk in, pick items off the shelf, and then walk out without needing to checkout using a traditional cashier.  Amazon, however, owns the AI technology and has been unwilling to license the technology to other retailers.   In October of 2021, Instacart acquired Caper AI for $350 million.  Caper AI is a startup company that builds smart carts and cashier-less checkout technology.   Instacart’s acquisition of Caper Carts gives the organization an AI-driven competitive advantage over its competitors.  In addition to automatically recognizing items placed in the cart, Caper Carts can also sync with the grocery stores loyalty program allowing shoppers to take advantage of additional savings.  Caper Carts also use AI algorithms to push customized advertisements, recipes, and purchase suggestions to the shopper that appear on the tablet-sized screen on the cart.  Instacart’s Caper Carts also offer gamification features that give shoppers rewards for fulfilling certain shopping behaviors.</p>

<p>Learning from Amazon’s restrictive licensing model and expensive infrastructure retrofitting costs, Instacart has taken a different approach and has licensed the AI Caper Cart technology to several grocers and retail partners.  Some of the well-known retail partners that currently use Caper Carts include Kroger, Schucks, Sobeys, Geissler’s, Super Market, and Wakefern Food Corp.</p>  
<p>Instacart is leveraging its Caper Cart technology to offer consumers an effortless and rewarding shopping experience through the use of its Caper Carts that calculates the total cost of all the items placed in the cart in real-time and displays the shopper's grocery items and total on an easy to use touch screen tablet that is built into the AI cart.  This technology allows shoppers to skip the checkout line.</p>
